Op-Ed Instructor Examples
-------------------------

Annotations by Robbie Stewart and Patrick White from the [Nuclear Science and Engineering Communication Lab](http://mitcommlab.mit.edu/nse/about-the-lab/).

[The false promise of nuclear power (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit22_011s20_anno_op_ed_2). An Op-Ed from the Boston Globe, annotated to show which parts constitute the lede, nut graf, argument, and call to action.

[How to meet Massachusetts’ energy needs (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit22_011s20_anno_op_ed_1). Another annotated Op-Ed from the Globe.

[Outline of the Op-Ed "How to meet Massachusetts' energy needs" (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit22_011s20_outline_op_ed). The same annotated Op-Ed with an outline of its key points.

[California's San Onofre nuclear plant is a Chernobyl waiting to happen (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit22_011s20_drycask_op_ed). An Op-Ed from the Los Angeles Times on dry casks. (Dry casks are cylindrical containers made of steel and concrete, each storing a few dozen elements of spent fuel from a nuclear reactor.)

[Dry casks rebuttal (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit22_011s20_drycask_rebutt). A rebuttal to the argument in the Times Op-Ed above, in the form of a letter to the editor.

[Dry casks technical note (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit22_011s20_drycask_technt). A technical note outlining scientific arguments that the Times Op-Ed is inaccurate.

Op-Ed Student Examples
----------------------

Students received training on how to write a traditional Op-Ed piece (~750 words) of the kind seen in newspapers. After choosing a topic related to nuclear science and engineering, they prepared a well-researched, one-page technical note (~850 words), and then transformed this technical note into an Op-Ed.

[Nuclear Energy’s Role in Decarbonization (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit22_011s20_decarbonization)

[To X-ray or Not to X-ray? That is the Question (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit22_011s20_x-ray_op_ed)

[Nuclear Energy: A Solution to the Biggest Problems (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit22_011s20_nuclearenergy)

[The Pros and Cons of Thorium as a Nuclear Fuel (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit22_011s20_thorium_op_ed)

[Nuclear Matters: And in the Context of the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election… (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit22_011s20_nuclearmatters)
